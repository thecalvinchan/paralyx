#Paralyx

I'm starting this project as a satirical piece on how a lot of sites suffer from poor performance because of extraneous and unnecessary parallax features. However, I haven't yet decided whether I actually want to create a lightweight parallax library, or just make it as inefficient as possible just for the lols. But for now, I'm naming it Paralyx, because it sounds look a cool start-up name (a combination of Paralyze and Parallax)
